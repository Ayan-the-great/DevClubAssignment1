The dev club as the name suggests is realated to software and app development. And the club innivates and invents ideas to create
softwares and systems that solves the problems of the campus and the students and also general public.
	
	For example, the study portal by devclub helps the students very much and the anonymous review system is pretty useful too.
Thus, I think the club consists of enthusastic students who team up together and are passionate to code and solve real world problems.
Thus, I too expect to do the same and want to learn from the cool seniors at dev club to hone my developer skills!
